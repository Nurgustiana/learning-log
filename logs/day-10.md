# Day 10 - January 21, 2026

## What I Learned Today
- continue learning freeCodeCamp CSS

## What I Built/Practiced
- Using attribute selector; list styling; CSS Grid and Flexbox (preview); Media Queries; CSS customer properties & @property.
- Built: Book Inventory App; Technical Document Page; Availability Table.

## Challenges I Faced
- I completed and passed the Availability Table (one of the certification project on FCC), but not really satisfied with the overall layout.

## How I Solved Them
- Will revisit and fine tune again later in future.

## Resources Used
- freeCodeCamp: "CSS"

## Time Spent
- Morning: 4.
- Afternoon: 2 hours (freeCodeCamp CSS lessons)
- Evening: 1
- **Total: 7 hours**

## Tomorrow's Goals
- Continue freeCodeCamp: Complete "CSS"
- exploring project
- Make my 11th daily commit

## Mood/Reflection
Need to maintain my pace; start to fell a bit slow, perhaps due to a lot of theory materials to read.

## Code Snippets Worth Remembering
@media screen and (feature: value) {
  /* css rule */
}

## What Surprised Me Today


## Questions for Tomorrow
- Where to find inspiration to start build my project :)
