# Day 2 - January 13, 2026

## What I Learned Today
- Created README.md file and learned Markdown formatting
- Started freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification
- Learned basic HTML structure (<!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <body>)
- Learned HTML tags: h1-h6, p, img, a (links)
- Understood how to add attributes to HTML elements (src, href, alt)
- Set up my daily logging system with proper Git workflow

## What I Built/Practiced
- Created a comprehensive README.md for my learning-log repository
- Completed "Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App" (Part 1) on freeCodeCamp
- Built a simple HTML page with headings, paragraphs, and an image
- Practiced Git commands multiple times (add, commit, push)
- Created proper folder structure (logs/ folder)

## Challenges I Faced
- Confused about when to use single quotes vs double quotes in HTML
- Forgot to save README.md file as .md extension at first
- Git kept saying "nothing to commit" because I forgot to save files
- Understanding the difference between <img> tag (self-closing) and other tags
- Learning all the Markdown syntax for formatting README

## How I Solved Them
- Learned that both single and double quotes work in HTML, just be consistent
- Made sure to save as README.md (not README.md.txt)
- Now I always save files (Ctrl+S) before running git commands
- Read MDN documentation about self-closing tags
- Kept a Markdown cheat sheet open while writing README

## Resources Used
- freeCodeCamp: "Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App"
- MDN Web Docs: HTML basics
- Markdown Guide for README formatting
- YouTube: "Markdown Crash Course"
- Claude: Help with README structure and daily logging workflow

## Time Spent
- Morning: 2.5 hours (freeCodeCamp HTML lessons)
- Afternoon: 2 hours (creating README, setting up logging system)
- Evening: 1 hour (creating Day 1 and Day 2 logs, Git practice)
- **Total: 5.5 hours**

## Tomorrow's Goals
- Continue freeCodeCamp: Complete "Learn HTML Forms by Building a Registration Form"
- Start learning basic CSS
- Complete "Learn Basic CSS by Building a Cafe Menu"
- Practice what I learned by adding CSS to my previous HTML projects
- Make my third daily commit

## Mood/Reflection
Feeling much more confident today! HTML is starting to make sense. I love that I can already build simple web pages. Creating the README and daily logs feels really professional - I'm proud of my setup. The Git workflow is becoming more natural. Can't wait to add colors and styling with CSS tomorrow! 💪

## Code Snippets Worth Remembering
```html
<!-- Basic HTML structure I'll use a lot -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My Heading</h1>
    <p>My paragraph</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
```markdown
<!-- Markdown for checkboxes in README -->
- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Incomplete task
```

## What Surprised Me Today
I didn't expect to enjoy the process of setting up my learning environment so much! Creating the README and daily logs makes this journey feel real and official. Also surprised by how quickly HTML basics clicked.

## Questions for Tomorrow
- When should I use <div> vs <section>?
- How do I make images responsive?
- What's the best way to organize CSS files?
