# Day 1 - January 12, 2026

## What I Learned Today
- Set up my GitHub account
- Created my learning-log repository
- Learned basic Git commands (init, add, commit, push)
- Started planning my 4-month full-stack developer journey
- Learned about freeCodeCamp and The Odin Project

## What I Built/Practiced
- Created GitHub repository for tracking my learning
- Set up Git on my computer
- Made my first commit and push to GitHub
- Created a learning plan for the next 4 months

## Challenges I Faced
- Understanding how Git works (what's the difference between add, commit, and push?)
- Remembering Git commands
- Figuring out how to navigate folders in terminal/command prompt
- Feeling overwhelmed by how much there is to learn

## How I Solved Them
- Watched YouTube tutorials on Git basics
- Wrote down Git commands on a note
- Practiced Git commands multiple times
- Reminded myself that every expert was once a beginner
- Broke down the 4 months into smaller, manageable chunks

## Resources Used
- GitHub.com - created my account
- Git documentation
- YouTube: "Git and GitHub for Beginners"
- Created my detailed 4-month learning plan with Claude

## Time Spent
- Morning: 1 hour (setting up GitHub, learning about Git)
- Afternoon: 2 hours (creating learning plan, understanding the roadmap)
- Evening: 1 hour (setting up repository, making first commits)
- **Total: 4 hours**

## Tomorrow's Goals
- Create README.md for my repository
- Create my first daily log (Day 2)
- Start freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certification
- Begin "Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App"
- Learn basic HTML tags

## Mood/Reflection
Excited and a bit nervous! This is a big commitment, but I'm ready. Setting up Git was confusing at first, but I'm starting to understand it. The 4-month plan looks challenging but doable if I stay consistent. Ready to actually start coding tomorrow!
